## About
CodeType is a test that measures how fast you type. Instead of using random words or passages from books, CodeType uses code from GitHub repos. 

## Code sources
CodeType allows you to pick between these code sources:
- Flask (Python)
- ASP.NET Core MVC (C#)
- Linux kernel (C)
- QMK firmware (C)
- Express (JS)

If there's a source you would like to see added, file an issue and I'll add it.
